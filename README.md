# TCPShield-IPWhitelist
Whitelist TCPShield's IPs on your selection of ports <br />
This script supports Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, Debian,and Ubuntu. <br>
`bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tommytran732/TCPShield-IPWhitelist/master/tcpshield.sh)`

# Notes
Before you run the script, makes sure you have not opened your Minecraft ports to all IPs as it will make this script useless. <br />
If you run SSHD on a port different from 22, make sure you have it opened or just change the command `ufw allow 22` to your appropriate port.
